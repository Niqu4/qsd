# My October CMS pet project for logistic company



## Minimum System Requirements

October CMS has a few system requirements:

* PHP version 7.2 or higher
* PDO PHP Extension (and relevant driver for the database you want to connect to)
* cURL PHP Extension
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension

When using Ubuntu, the following command can be run to install all required extensions:

```bash

sudo apt-get install php php-ctype php-curl php-xml php-fileinfo php-gd php-json php-mbstring php-mysql php-sqlite3 php-zip
```
